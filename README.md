Kits
====

Kits plugin for Bukkit API

This is a maven project - fork and run "mvn clean install"

NOTE: Sorry for all the commits (27/04/2013); some crazy stuff started happening and my target/ folder and .gitignore file added themselves to the repository, and no matter what I did, they wouldn't unignore themselves. The target folder is gone but for some reason the .gitignore isn't. Please feel free to suggest any possible way for me to do this without causing things to break.
