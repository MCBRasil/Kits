# Battlegear - Ladder & Item Configuration              #
# ----------------------------------------------------- #
# This file is used to store all of the Battlegear's    #
# references to items and their corresponding defined   #
# ladders.                                              #
#                                                       #
# A Ladder is a group in which items are distributed;   #
# Each ladder can have its own item name color, item    #
# lore color and drop chance (So you can have junk      #
# items which drop frequently and legendary items which #
# drop rarely).                                         #
#                                                       #
# ----------------------------------------------------- #
# You can only use color on items if it's leather.      #
# Apply the following to the options of the item:       #
#     color: 255,255,255   # (red,green,blue)           #
# This example will color the item white.               #

# About maximum-chance                                  #
# ----------------------------------------------------- #
# Maximum chance is the plugin's global maximum chance  #
# variable. Think of it kind of like a percentage.      #
# If you have a maximum chance of 100, and the junk     #
# ladder has a chance of 15, that means any item in the #
# junk ladder has a 15% chance to drop...               #
# (if the item doesn't have a custom chance variable)   #
#                                                       #
# Chance is also used for critical hits in the same way #
#                                                       #

# All chat color codes work for item name and lore,     #

# Finally, if you have essentials god-mode on, this     #
# will make the damage modifiers of Battlegear          #
# inoperable. Disable godmode for your players for it   #

# Salvaging Items                                       #
# ----------------------------------------------------- #
# Items with the salvage section can be salvaged for    #
# the blocks that are specified in that section. For    #
# example:                                              #
#                                                       #
# salvage:                                              #
# - 3x5                                                 #
# - 4                                                   #
#                                                       #
# This will salvage the item for 3 wood and 1 cobble.   #
# If an item is in a ladder with junk:true, it will not #
# ask for confirmation when salvaging.                  #
